                <h2>Academic Projects/Assignments</h2>
                <p>I've completed many projects and assignments as a student at Ontario Tech University. Here are some of my achievements:</p>
                
                <section class="project">
                    <h3>Database Management System</h3>
                    <p>Designed and implemented a relational database for a library management system. Created tables, relationships, and wrote SQL queries to manage book inventory and user records.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="project">
                    <h3>RISC-V Fibonacci Sequence</h3>
                    <p>Designed a program using RISC-V assembly language that recites the fibonacci sequence, up to a specified number times. Created completely from scratch and wrote all code from scratch, using the assembler and runtime simulator, RARS.</p>
                </section>
                
                <section class="project">
                    <h3>Leadership Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Analyzed and studied character "Jean-Luc Picard" from a leadership perspective, and presented my description and analysis. I and other group members chose several characters from fiction that portray strong leadership aspects and laid out our findings in the form of a presentation.</p>
                </section>
                
                <section class="project">
                    <h3>A (Simulated) Pilot Network</h3>
                    <p>Designed a simulated pilot network using Packet Tracer. The pilot network involved setting up multiple network switches, routers, PCs and routing them all together, accross multiple different networks. My group members and I set up and ensured there was full connectivity within the network.</p>
